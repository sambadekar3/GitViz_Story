## GitHub_Cities

This project is still under development and will be updated from time to time.
I'm currently doing user study before continuing further development.

You can check the latest application at:

Please give it some time to load.

### Description:
GitCities is a visualization concept that attempts to capture the dynamic nature of the activity on GitHub. Here Iâ€™ve used city as a base metaphor because cities, in my opinion, are the best examples of dynamism. For each city there are areas that see more traffic during different times of the day and different days of the week. There are opinions and ideologies that resonate within the residents. Each and every city in our world has a character of its own and the best way to know a city is to visit it.


The mapping is done using following relations:
- If an organization is considered like a city then,
- Each project could be a building and
- Each developer/contributor will be a citizen.

For this POC I have used Mozilla's public repositories and contributors on GitHub.

### Project Dependencies:
- Three.js (A beautiful library for 3D programming)
- jquery (Not mandatory. Currently used for html elements only)
- Your imagination

### Note: 
You are free to use the concept / idea as long as you promise to make it more beautiful.
